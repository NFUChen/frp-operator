# frp Operator

The frp Kubernetes Operator is a powerful tool that manages and automates the deployment of frp clients (connected to exit servers) and tunnels within your Kubernetes cluster. This operator watches two custom resources: `ExitServer` and `Tunnel`.

## What is frp?

[frp (Fast Reverse Proxy)](https://github.com/fatedier/frp) is an open-source tool that allows you to expose local servers to the internet securely and efficiently. It supports protocols like TCP, UDP, HTTP, and HTTPS, making it ideal for scenarios such as remote access, self-hosted applications, and cloud-native workloads.

## Generic Description

The frp Kubernetes Operator simplifies the deployment of frp clients and tunnels in your Kubernetes cluster. It eliminates the need for manual tunnels to ingress and external load balancer services.

### Use Cases

- Private cloud or home lab environments
- Self-hosted applications and APIs
- Testing and collaboration with colleagues or clients
- Integration with webhooks and third-party APIs

### Features

- No need for firewall port opening or port-forwarding rules
- Public IP is automatically assigned for TCP traffic
- Exit servers are created in your preferred cloud with cost-effective plans
- Compatible with any IngressController
- Portable IP address for flexibility

### Built with the Operator SDK

This operator was built using the [Operator SDK](https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/building-operators/), a toolkit that simplifies the creation of Kubernetes operators. The SDK streamlines the process of defining, developing, and deploying custom resources.

## Installation via Helm

To install the frp Operator using Helm, follow these steps:

Install the frp Operator from the OCI registry:

```bash
helm install my-frp-operator oci://ghcr.io/nfuchen/charts/frp-operator --version 1.0.5
```

   This will deploy the frp operator into your Kubernetes cluster.

## Exit Server Resource

An `ExitServer` resource defines the configuration for a frp exit server. Here's a sample ExitServer manifest:

```yaml
apiVersion: frp.aureum.cloud/v1
kind: ExitServer
metadata:
  name: exit-server-sample
spec:
  host: 12.345.67.89
  port: 7000
  authentication:
    token:
      secretKeyRef:
        name: exit-server-authentication
        key: token
```

### Add a secret

To add a secret for exit server authentication, you can use the following `kubectl` command:

```bash
kubectl -n sample create secret generic exit-server-authentication --from-literal=token=RDqQD6QX0ivEh2OGxjtagxpdQQoqYcAes5GrL0Wvp1XgsTE_FW
```

This command creates a generic secret named `exit-server-authentication` in the `sample` namespace. The secret contains a single key-value pair with the key `token` and the provided value `RDqQD6QX0ivEh2OGxjtagxpdQQoqYcAes5GrL0Wvp1XgsTE_FW`. This secret can then be referenced in your `ExitServer` resource for authentication.

### Exit Server Configuration

- **host**: IP address or domain of the exit server.
- **port**: Port on which the exit server is running.
- **authentication**: Configuration for server authentication.
  - **token**: Secret reference for authentication.

## Tunnel Resource

A `Tunnel` resource configures a frp tunnel to expose a port from a Kubernetes service. Below is a sample Tunnel manifest:

```yaml
apiVersion: frp.aureum.cloud/v1
kind: Tunnel
metadata:
  name: tunnel-sample
spec:
  exitServer: exit-server-sample
  tcp:
    localPort: 1234
    remotePort: 1234
    serviceRef:
      name: my-tcp-svc
      namespace: web-app
  transport:
    useEncryption: true
    useCompression: false
    proxyProtocol: v2
    bandwidthLimit: 100MB
```

### Tunnel Configuration

- **exitServer**: Reference to the associated ExitServer.
- Exactly one proxy type must be configured: `tcp`, `udp`, `http`, `https`, `tcpmux`, `stcp`, `xtcp`, or `sudp`.
- **tcp / udp**: Port-forwarding proxy configuration.
- **http / https**: Virtual-host proxy configuration using `customDomains` or `subdomain`.
- **tcpmux**: TCP multiplexing using the `httpconnect` multiplexer.
- **stcp / xtcp / sudp**: Secret-key protected visitor proxy configuration. XTCP additionally supports `natTraversal`.
- **serviceRef / localPort**: Kubernetes service backend. Proxy types that support plugins use either this backend or `plugin`, but not both.
- **plugin**: frpc client plugin. Supported plugin types are `http2http`, `http2https`, `https2http`, `https2https`, `http_proxy`, `socks5`, `static_file`, `unix_domain_socket`, `tls2raw`, and `virtual_net`.
- **enabled**: Explicitly disable a proxy by setting this to `false`.
- **annotations / metadatas**: frp proxy annotations and metadata.
- **loadBalancer**: frp load-balancer `group` and optional `groupKey`.
- **healthCheck**: TCP or HTTP health checking, including intervals, timeout, failure threshold, path, and headers.
- **tcp**: TCP configuration for the tunnel.
  - **localPort**: Local port to expose.
  - **remotePort**: Remote port on the exit server.
  - **serviceRef**: Reference to the Kubernetes service.
- **transport**: Transport configuration for the tunnel.
  - **useEncryption**: Enable or disable encryption.
  - **useCompression**: Enable or disable compression.
  - **proxyProtocol**: Proxy protocol version.
  - **bandwidthLimit**: Bandwidth limit such as `100MB` or `1.5MB`.
  - **bandwidthLimitMode**: `client` or `server`; frp v0.71.0 defaults to `client` when a limit is configured.

See `config/samples/frp_v1_tunnel_v071.yaml` for UDP, HTTPS plugin, TCPMux, STCP, XTCP, SUDP, load-balancing, and health-check examples.
